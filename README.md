# Leaf-Disease-Prediction-using-VGG16
Leaf disease is predicted using a deep learning algorithm VGG16 (a Deep Convolutional Neural Network)
# Project Requisites
* Jupyter Notebook
* Visual Studio code
# Packages Required 
* Tensorflow
* Scikit
* Keras
# About Project
The dataset is taken from UCI which consists of 38 classfications of leaf disease with 80000+ image samples. The Algorithm VGG16 is deep convolutional neural network which consist of 12.6 billion pretrained neurons in imagenet which can also be used but in case the pretrained neurons is delected and trained the architecture using our dataset wih 80% of images as training set and 20% as validation set.

# Caution 
 - `VGG16 is High Computational Algorithm which requires a lot of GPU for Training the algorithm` |
 - `Normal Computers can handle but takes lotz and lotz of time in my case it is 5 days for 10 + 5 epochs, so plan your project accordingly
